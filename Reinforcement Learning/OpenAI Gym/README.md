This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of OpenAI Gym with environments tailored for Reinforcement Learning, specifically using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithms. 
These examples leverage the Stable Baselines3 library to implement these algorithms in a simulated highway driving environment.
